<div class="para">
<p>Central universities or union universities in India are public universities established by an Act of Parliament and are under the purview of the Department of Higher Education in the Ministry of Education. In general, universities in India are recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which draws its power from the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. In addition, 15 Professional Councils are established, controlling different aspects of accreditation and coordination. Central universities, in addition, are covered by the Central Universities Act, 2009, which regulates their purpose, powers, governance etc., and established 12 new universities. As of 31 March 2021, The list of central universities published by the UGC includes 54 central universities.</p>
<p>Apart from the above universities, other institutions are granted the permission to autonomously award degrees. These institutes do not affiliate colleges and are not officially called "universities" but "autonomous organisations" or "autonomous institutes". They fall under the administrative control of the Department of Higher Education. These organisations include the Indian Institutes of Technology, the National Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, the Indian Institutes of Engineering Science and Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management, the National Law Schools, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and other autonomous institutes.</p>
